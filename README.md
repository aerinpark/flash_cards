# Vocab with Me üìñ

### About this project

Have you ever had trouble memorizing new vocabulary, whether it is in your native language or a new language you're learning? Do you spend all your time writing new words over and over on a piece of paper?

This simple vocabulary program will help you enhance your vocabulary. You can add new words to the program, go through the study cards, and the program will automatically sort them into two files: words memorized and words to be memorized.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/aerinpark/flash_cards.git `
2. Run the program<br>
   `python3 main.py`

### Buttons
1. ‚ûï : Add a new word.
2. üîÑ : Flip the card between the word and its definition.
3. ‚úîÔ∏è : Mark as memorized.
4. ‚ùå : Mark as not memorized.

### Files
Three different Excel files (.csv) created.
1. original_word_list.csv - A list of all the words you added.
2. words_memorized.csv - A list of all the words that you have memorized.
3. words_to_learn.csv - A list of all the words that you have not memorized yet.
